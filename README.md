### Hiya! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Andrew. Dad, husband, software consultant and a content creator too now, I guess! Living in Scotland.

I've built software since Turbo Pascal on an Amstrad - an old language no one remembers for an old computer no one used.

I'm creating content for my [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@metaphoricallyspeaking) channel while also doing some consulting.

Previously, I've held roles such as Staff Engineer and VP of Engineering. Worked at TransferGo building Compliance, Risk and Anti-money Laundering things.

I spend my spare time kayaking and coaching youth football.

That's enough about me: introduce yourself!
